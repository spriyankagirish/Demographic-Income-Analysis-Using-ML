# Demographic-Income-Analysis-Using-ML
An analysis of the Adult dataset to explore demographic factors affecting income levels, with machine learning models used to predict whether individuals earn over $50K.
 


The notebook is focused on analyzing a dataset (from the Adult dataset) with the following steps:

### Objective:
The project aims to analyze the "Adult" dataset, which includes demographic and income information, to explore and evaluate how various features influence income levels (particularly whether a person earns more or less than $50K). The analysis begins with loading the data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify key patterns in the data, preprocess it for machine learning models, and assess model performance in predicting income levels.

### Key Steps:
1. Data Loading & Exploration: Initial loading of the data and understanding its structure.
2. Data Visualization: Use of EDA techniques to visualize the distribution of key features like race, gender, and income.
3. Data Preparation: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
4. Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing machine learning models (such as Logistic Regression) to predict income levels and evaluate the model's performance.

### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals significant income disparities based on race and gender. For instance, a higher percentage of men across all races tend to earn more than $50K compared to women. Black females are more likely to earn less than $50K compared to black males, highlighting income inequality. Furthermore, white males dominate the higher income bracket, while other racial groups are underrepresented. This analysis demonstrates the power of machine learning models in predicting income categories but also emphasizes systemic inequalities that persist in the dataset.
